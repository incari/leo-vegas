# Thank you

I'm very grateful for the opportunity to show my work and hopefully ends working with you.

# App Components:

I found that many of the tasks have already a component to resolve it so I decide to use it instead of creating a new ones.
And me modifications were the smallest as possible to achieve the same result and keep the code clean.

# State Management:

I use the local state for the infinite scroll to avoid the need to pass the state to the child components. But later I changed to redux to have one source of truth.


# API Calls:
I refactored the api calls to a customs hooks.
