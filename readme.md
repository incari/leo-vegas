# Code Readabiity:
    Comments are sparse. Adding more comments would improve code readability.
    Some function and variable names could be more descriptive.

# Error Handling:
    Limited error handling, especially for network requests.

# App Componenet:
    Is cluttered and handles multiple responsibilities. It should be refactored into smaller components.

# State Management:
    Some state is managed locally within components when it could be moved to the Redux store for better state management.

# API Calls:
    API call logic is directly in components. This should be abstracted to a separate service layer.
